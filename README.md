# Hopeless
A small jumper game, where you have to jump over obstacles and collect coins, while you're being chased by a dark fog, trying to consume you.
I've only added a few scripts, so the game isn't playable:
-The controller, which is essential to make the objects move.
-The player's movement, which allows the player to jump.
-And the dark fog's script, which handles the movement of the fog.
